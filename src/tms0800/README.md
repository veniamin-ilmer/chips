#TMS0800

The TMS0800 was introduced in 1973 as a child of the founding TMS0100.

It was build with a 8 Î¼m process node, with roughly 5000 transistors.

Each ROM word is 11 bits. Each memory address is 9 bits. All instructions take up only one word each.

Each Register is 44 bits. (11 nibbles).

There is a word select / mask, taking up 11 bits. Notice, they do everything in 11s here..

It was a "calculator on a single chip", including the RAM, ROM, Control Unit, ALU, and several Programmable Logic Arrays (PLA).

The PLA is like a configuration used to tell how certain instructions should work.

This emulation reads both the ROM and ALU PLA.

The original chips ran at 1 bit per clock cycle, but though it can update up to 44 bits of a register, within one clock cycle.

The run_cycle command runs per instruction, not per clock, however inside it emulates much of the shift registers that exist in the chip.

The ALU was only capable of doing BCD math, with 4 bits per digit. 9 + 1 = 0 with a carry, not 0xA.

The control instructions and ALU instructions were very neatly separated, and hence I have two different objects for handling these.
