# MCS-4 (4 bit Micro Computer System) - Intel 4000 family

Produced in 1971, containing 2300 transistors, with a 10 Î¼m process node.

Each clock cycle was 1.35 microseconds (740 kHz). Each instruction took 8 - 16 clock cycles. So, instructions took 10.8 - 21.6 microseconds (46.3 - 92.6 kHz).

Many of these clock cycles were useless, caused by Intel's self imposed limit of 16 pins on the 4004. So a lot of time was spent simply sending data in small batches.

Future chips increased the pin count, so more data could be sent at once, reducing the clock cycles required.

Although this emulation closely emulates the instruction cycle, it does NOT imulate the individual clock cycles. They are too inefficient and make the code difficult to read.

It does emulate each instruction cycle. Instructions which take two instruction cycles will take really take two cycles to run. To accomplish this, the chip remembers the previous state.
