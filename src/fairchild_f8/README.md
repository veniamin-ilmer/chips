# Fairchild F8

The Fairchild F8 introduced on April 1975, is an 8 bit microcontroller.

It runs at 500 ns per clock tick. There are 4 to 26 clocks per instruction, hence 2 to 13 microseconds per instruction.

It had an unusual chip design, dividing the CPU into two separate chips. The 3850 CPU and the 3851 PSU (Program Storage Unit). The PSU contained the ROM, but also contained code and data indexing registers.

It's almost as if the PSU was an iterator, rather than an array. The CPU asked for the next data rather than holding onto an index.
